## Operating instruction
The current script is made exclusively for visualizing the relationship between COVID data from the NYT covid 19 data from the "covid bot" and PM2.5 Air Quality from "aqs.epa.gov/". At the moment, the years 2020 and 2021 are compared by this script. To change the observed years, small additions/modifications must be made to the code.
To utilize the script, please run all code chunks. If errors appear, please check whether the correct libraries are indeed present or restart the kernal and "run all".
